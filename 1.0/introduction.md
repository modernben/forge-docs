## What is Forge?

Laravel Forge is a server management and site deployment service. After connecting to your preferred server provider, Forge will provision a new server, installing and configuring:

- Nginx
- PHP
- MySQL / Postgres / MariaDB (if selected)
- Logrotate
- UFW Firewall
- OPcache
- Memcached
- Redis
- MeiliSearch
- Automatic Security Updates
- And more!

In addition, Forge can assist you in managing scheduled jobs, queue workers, SSL certificates, and more. After a server has provisioned, you can then deploy your PHP / Laravel applications or WordPress applications using the Forge UI dashboard.

## Learning More

Laracasts has a comprehensive and **free** [video course](https://laracasts.com/series/learn-laravel-forge) on Forge. Feel free to review this course if you are new to Laravel Forge and want a video overview of its features.

## Forge IP Addresses

If you are restricting SSH access to your server using IP allow lists, you should allow the following IP addresses:

- `159.203.161.246`
- `159.203.163.240`

You can also access the IP addresses via the following URL: [https://forge.laravel.com/ips-v4.txt](https://forge.laravel.com/ips-v4.txt). This is particulary useful if you intend on automating your network or firewall infrastructure.

Your server should also allow incoming and outgoing traffic from `forge.laravel.com`.

:::warning IP Address Changes

The Forge IP addresses may change from time to time; however, we will always email you several weeks prior to an IP address change.
